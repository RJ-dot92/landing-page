this is my first real project since i started learning web development. i learned some extra stuff like adding curves to borders and adding special symbols.
aligning the elements was quite challenging but i figured it eventually. html was very easy to write unlike css. i hope i make better projects than this in the future
and it took me 6 hours. i split it to two days.
